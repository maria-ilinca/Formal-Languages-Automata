# ProiectLFA
LAB 1
Exercise 1. Implement a library/program in a programming language of
your choosing to load and validate a DFA input file of the format presented in
the Appendix.
dfa_parser_engine.py dfa_config_file

Exercise 2. Implement a library/program in a programming language of
your choosing to test acceptance of a DFA - loaded from a DFA config file.

LAB 2
Exercise 1. Extend the library/program you implemented in L1.Ex1 to
load and validate a NFA input file.
nfa_parser_engine.py nfa_config_file

Exercise 2. Implement a library/program in a programming language of
your choosing to test acceptance of a NFA - loaded from a NFA config file.
nfa_acceptance_engine.py nfa_config_file <word to test >
 
Exercise 3. Implement a library/program in a programming language of
your choosing to convert a NFA - loaded from a NFA config file, to a DFA.
nfa_conversion_engine.py nfa_config_file
  
LAB 3
Exercise 1. Implement a library/program in a programming language ofyour choosing to simulate the Myhill-Nerode theorem - minimize a DFA to thesmallest DFA with the same level ofcompleteness.
dfa_minimization_engine.py dfa_config_file
  
Exercise 2. Implement a library/program in a programming lan-guage of your choosing to minimize a DFA to the smallest (potentially) incomplete DFA.
